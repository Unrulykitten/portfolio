		<h2>Proposition: A Decade Since Paris: Western Countries Cut Emissions China Still Dominates Global Output
		</h2>

			<h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

				<figcaption>
					<strong>A Decade Since Paris Agreement: Western Countries Cut Emissions, China Still Dominates
						Global Output </strong><br>
					G20 nations account for over 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with China alone responsible
					for nearly one-third—more than five times the emissions of the entire European Union (EU). Since the
					Paris Agreement, significant emission reductions have occurred across the United States, Brazil,
					Japan, Europe, and Australia. The United Kingdom leads this positive trend, cutting annual emissions
					by over 25%.

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>1. Using total GHG emissions data to highlight China’s dominance</strong><br>Score: +1<br>By
					focusing on total emissions, the visualization reinforces the narrative that China is the largest
					contributor to global emissions.</li>
				<li><strong>2. Selecting post-2015 cumulative emissions to align with the Paris Agreement
						timeline</strong><br>Score: -1<br>Using post-2015 data highlights contrasts between developed
					and emerging economies post-agreement, though it omits the longer historical trend.</li>
				<li><strong>3. Excluding COVID-19 years (2020-2021) from emission trends</strong><br>Score:
					-2<br>Excluding these years makes reductions among Western nations look more consistent, amplifying
					the perceived success of advanced economies.</li>
				<li><strong>4. Focusing on G20 countries only</strong><br>Score: +2<br>G20 nations cover over 80% of
					global emissions, making them a logical and geopolitically influential focus group.</li>
				<li><strong>5. Persuasive narrative and framing through titles and captions</strong><br>Score: -2<br>The
					wording pushes readers to see Western nations as climate leaders while framing China as the main
					problem.</li>

			<h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

			<figure>
				<img src="../images/Assignment4/A402.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					<strong>Western Nations: Leading Per Capita Polluters And Struggling to Meet Climate
						Targets</strong><br>
					Residents of North America have among the highest per capita greenhouse gas emissions globally.
					Within the G20, Australia, Saudi Arabia, Canada, and the United States emit nearly three times more
					per person than Europe and the UK, and roughly 50% more than China. To achieve their 2030 national
					climate targets, Canada, the United States, and Brazil must reduce their emissions per capita by
					30–50%.
					<br>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>1. Switching from total emissions to per capita emissions</strong><br>Score: 0<br>This shift
					reframes the issue by emphasizing individual responsibility over total output, neutral but
					impactful.</li>
				<li><strong>2. Focusing on 2023 per capita data</strong><br>Score: -1<br>Using the most recent year ties
					emissions data closely to current population figures, making the comparison relevant and timely. But
					this ignores the yearly fluctuation, potentially undermining fair presentation.</li>
				<li><strong>3. Ranking bar charts by distance from national 2030 targets while omitting details about
						target ambition</strong><br>Score: -1<br>The bar charts rank countries by how far they are from
					meeting their 2030 targets, emphasizing Western countries' underperformance. However, by not
					clarifying that these national targets are often less ambitious than the global 2°C goal, the
					visualization amplifies the perceived gap without full context.</li>
				<li><strong>4. Maintaining layout and color scheme from the first infographic for direct
						contrast</strong><br>Score: 0<br>This allows viewers to easily compare both graphics, drawing
					attention to the change in narrative focus.</li>
				<li><strong>5. Persuasive narrative and framing through titles and captions</strong><br>Score: -2<br>The
					titles and captions were deliberately crafted to steer readers’ attention toward Western nations'
					poor per capita performance and their failure to meet targets, while positioning China more
					favorably by comparison. This choice helps frame Western countries as the key culprits in per capita
					pollution, reinforcing the overall critical narrative.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Final Reflection</h2>

			<p>In Infographic 1, I designed the layout and organized the data to highlight how Western nations have been
				reducing emissions since the Paris Agreement, while portraying China as the leading contributor to
				global greenhouse gas emissions. This perspective is strengthened by showcasing cumulative emissions
				since 2015, but excluding the years affected by COVID-19 allows Western reductions to appear more
				significant than they might seem over a longer timeframe. Focusing exclusively on the G20 nations is
				justifiable given their global influence; however, the language used in the titles and captions conveys
				a distinctly pro-Western narrative.</p>

			<p>In Infographic 2, I changed the perspective by focusing on per capita emissions to emphasize that Western
				nations are the highest individual polluters. Including 2023 data keeps the chart relevant, but not
				providing context on how strict national targets are could mislead viewers into believing that Western
				nations are performing disproportionately poorly. By maintaining a consistent design style, I created an
				impactful direct comparison, but this also limited the amount of nuance I could include. Both designs
				are persuasive, but they rely on framing choices to present contrasting interpretations of the same
				dataset.</p>

			<p>In my visualization design process, the technical aspects such as data processing, map creation, and bar
				chart construction were relatively straightforward. However, crafting two opposing frames with
				persuasive language while maintaining factual integrity proved to be challenging.</p>

			<p>In my view, ethical analysis and visualization in data journalism involve presenting data truthfully
				while being transparent about limitations, methods, and framing choices. Persuasive visualizations
				become "misleading" when they selectively omit key context, manipulate scales, or frame narratives in a
				way that distorts the audience's understanding of the issue. Acceptable persuasive choices prioritize
				clarity, relevance, and honest storytelling—such as selecting pertinent timeframes or focusing on
				specific metrics—provided they do not obscure critical counterpoints or exaggerate trends. The
				distinction between acceptable and misleading often rests on intent and transparency: Are you aiming to
				guide the reader toward a data-driven insight, or are you constructing a narrative that cherry-picks and
				oversimplifies at the expense of truth? In ethical data journalism, being transparent about your
				editorial decisions is as important as the visual output itself.</p>
