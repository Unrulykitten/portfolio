			<h2>Insight & Critique</h2>

			<figure>
				<img src="https://vis-society.github.io/assets/imgs/covid-spiral.png" alt="" />
			</figure>

			<h3>Insights:</h3>


			<ul>
				<li><strong>Unique & Intuitive Design</strong> – The spiral timeline effectively represents time as a continuous cycle, similar to natural patterns like the Earth's rotation or moon phases.</li>
				<li><strong>Seasonal Patterns & Recurring Trends</strong> – The 12-month cycle clearly shows seasonal trends in COVID-19 cases, particularly highlighting the winter surges at the end of 2021 and early 2022.</li>
				<li><strong>Comparative Time Progression</strong> – The layered spiral format allows for easy comparison of different years (2020–2022) and encourages readers to consider potential trends in upcoming months.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Critique:</h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Lack of Clear Axis Labels & Scale</strong> – The curved axis lacks well-defined scales, making it difficult to interpret precise values. Readers may overestimate or underestimate the magnitude of different peaks.</li>
				<li><strong>Absence of Exact Data Points</strong> – While the visualization effectively shows trends, it lacks specific numerical markers, making it harder to extract precise insights.</li>
				<li><strong>Flat Color Scheme</strong> – The single-tone red shading does not provide strong contrast between different peaks, reducing the clarity of trend fluctuations.</li>
				<li><strong>Unnecessary Central Axis</strong> – The central radial axis does not add meaningful value and could be removed or redesigned to improve readability.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>

      <figure>
				<img src="../images/Assignment3/Sketch1.jpeg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
			 Revised COVID-19 spiral visualization combines both confirmed cases and deaths to provide a more comprehensive view of the pandemic's impact over time. Key milestones, peak daily cases, and death counts are highlighted to enhance storytelling, while adjustments to axis labeling and benchmarks improve readability.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h3>Design Rationale</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Depicting Severity Beyond Case Counts:</strong> Since confirmed cases alone may not fully capture the pandemic’s severity, especially with the rise of asymptomatic cases, this design incorporates both confirmed cases and deaths for a clearer representation.</li>
				<li><strong>Enhancing the Story and Depth by Highlighting Critical Peaks & Events:</strong> Labels and markers were added to emphasize key milestones such as peak daily cases, total deaths surpassing milestones, and policy changes.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Pros:</h3>
			<ul>
		<p>✔ <strong>Dual Representation:</strong> Cases and deaths together offer a more comprehensive view.</p>
		<p>✔ <strong>Improved Labeling:</strong> Months and weeks are clearly marked for better time tracking.</p>
		<p>✔ <strong>Additional Benchmarks:</strong> More reference points aid in interpretation.</p>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Cons:</h3>
			<ul>
		<p>✖ <strong>Visual Clutter:</strong> Overlapping curves and spiral layers can complicate interpretation.</p>
		<p>✖ <strong>Flattened Peaks:</strong> The spiral curvature distorts trends, particularly for the death curve.</p>
		<p>✖ <strong>Lack of Thematic Focus:</strong> The key events need a more cohesive theme to guide the audience through the data effectively.</p>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Next Steps:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Explore using different marks or testing alternative layouts for improved clarity.</li>
				<li>Refine the selection of events to create a stronger narrative.</li>
			</ul>
			

			<figure>

				<figcaption>
				The revised spiral visualization highlights COVID-19 spread trends and severity across seasons. Two distinct markers differentiate new cases and deaths, while background colors emphasize seasonal patterns for better trend recognition.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h3>Pros:</h3>
			<ul>
				<p>✔ <strong>Effective Bubble Encoding:</strong> Warm colors represent high mortality rates, while larger bubbles highlight peak severity, making winter surges easy to interpret.</p>
				<p>✔ <strong>Improved Visual Clarity:</strong> Addressed most previous sketch issues related to layout clarity, label readability, and data emphasis.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Cons:</h3>
			<ul>
				<p>✖ <strong>Color Palette Needs Refinement.</strong> </p>
				<p>✖ <strong>Loss of Timeline Information:</strong> The colorful background and marks make it difficult to highlight key events and reference points.</p>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Next Steps:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Explore an alternative layout and try to both visual clearity and information richness.</li>
			</ul>
			
		
			<figure>
				<img src="../images/Assignment3/sketch3.jpeg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This chart presents a wave of COVID-19 outbreaks, mortality rates, and highlights key events and public health policies on a shared timeline.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h3>Design Rationale</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Layout shifted to a line chart with a shared X-axis, maintaining the same concept as the previous spiral chart but hoping to improve clarity.</li>
				<li><strong>Carefully chosen Y-axis range and scale to reveal the Case-Death Relationship: </strong> The top section shows confirmed new cases, and the bottom section shows deaths, plotted in a 100:1 scale, making it easier to compare trends.</li>
				<li>Experimented with a logarithmic scale but opted for a linear scale that <strong>shows the magnitude</strong> of peaks better.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Pros:</h3>
			<ul>
				<p>✔ <strong>Improved Readability:</strong> The key phases and milestone events were easier to interpret than the spiral chart.</p>
				<p>✔ <strong>Clear Outbreak Trends:</strong> Effectively shows pandemic waves and mortality patterns.</p>
				<p>✔ <strong>Better Quantification:</strong> Allows direct comparison of confirmed cases and deaths.</p>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Cons</h3>
			<ul>
				<p>✖ <strong>Not Emphasized Seasonality:</strong> It is present but does not guide the focus.</p>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Next Steps</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Modify the layout to retain seasonality insights.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="../images/Assignment3/sketch4.jpeg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This line chart compares yearly COVID-19 trends, highlighting the U-shaped pattern of confirmed cases and deaths across 2020, 2021, and 2022. The design focuses on visualizing trends rather than emphasizing milestone events.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h3>Pros:</h3>
			<ul>
				<p>✔ <strong>Clear Yearly Comparison:</strong> Effectively highlights <strong>similar trends across years</strong>.</p>
				<p>✔ <strong>Trend-Focused Representation:</strong> Clearly shows trends while still allowing readers to <strong>zoom into data details</strong>.</p>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Cons:</h3>
			<ul>
				<p>✖ <strong>Lacks Milestone Context:</strong> Difficult to <strong>denote timeline context information</strong>.</p>
				<p>✖ <strong>Limited Narrative Element:</strong> The focus is purely on <strong>trends</strong>, making it less engaging for storytelling.</p>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Thoughts for Final Visualization:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Explore hybrid designs that balance trend visualization with key events and context information.</li>
				<li>Refine the visual hierarchy. so the chart presents both broad trends, contextual information, and precise data details.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Final Visualization Design</h2>
      
			<figure>
				<img src="../images/Assignment3/FinalA3.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					The primary goal of this visualization is to tell a story about the pandemic over a three-year timeline, highlighting the seasonal trends of COVID-19 case surges from 2020 to 2022. It also incorporates contextual information such as public health policies and key pandemic milestones, allowing the reader to interpret the patterns effectively.
				</figcaption>

			<h2>Design Decisions </h2>

			<p>The radial design reflects natural cycles, like moon phases and the Earth's rotation, reinforcing the concept of time progression while facilitating direct yearly comparisons. Each ring represents a 12-month cycle, allowing for direct comparison of yearly trends in both new cases and death numbers.</p>
			
			<p>The largest surges are represented by larger bubbles, high mortality numbers are indicated by warm-colored bubbles, with densely clustered event markers in the background. This design naturally draws attention to the peak winter months. After observing the broader trends, readers are encouraged to zoom in on specific periods by consulting the timeline captions.</p>
			
			<p>This final visualization aims to strike an optimal balance between clarity, engagement, and data precision by addressing critiques from earlier iterations. Improvements include clear axis labeling, precise data references, the removal of the central point, and enhanced color dynamics. The style and color palette draw inspiration from Giorgia Lupi's <i>"Data Humanism,"</i> creating an engaging yet data-driven narrative.</p>
			
			<h2> Final Reflection </h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Hierarchy, Structure and Visual Consistency</strong>are essential when combining multiple layers of information into a single visualization.
				Hierarchy and Structure Helps guide the reader through the data and Visual Consistency creates a cohesive narrative.</li>
				<li><strong>Combining Broad Trends with Context</strong> Presenting broad trends alongside background context and detailed data points enhances the depth of the narrative and bolsters the credibility of the visualization.</li>
			</ul>
